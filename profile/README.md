This is the Github repository for the eSSIF-Lab granted project titled DOOR. DOOR has created the first instance of a library that can enable the use of hardware-based keys for supporting the protection of the Wallet running on the Holder side. The endmost goal of DOOR is to transfer the root-of-trust of the SSI ecosystem purely on the digital wallet (aligned also with the vision of the EUDI) by considering an underlying Trusted Component as part of the Wallet, without making any assumptions on the trustworthiness of the other layers.

The core Wallet_DAA_Bridge component provided leverages a privacy-preserving cryptographic protocol, namely Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA), to provide verifiable evidence and assurances about the presented Verifiable Credential's (VC) origin and integrity. Through this feature, we can now enforce that a VC (or Verifiable Presentation (VP)) can only be issued by an attested Issuer and that this VC is binded to the Holder's Device (Wallet), overcoming the current limitations of bare proof-of-possession sw-based key.

Furthermore, all the DAA Core functionalities have been packaged as a library (daa_core) that can be used by any application that can attest the state of the user's host device, irrespective of the underlying root-of-trust and the type of device. Further to this, the current implementation has been instantiated with the latest TPM 2.0 secure element providing the necessary code for the TPM Setup as well as all the necessary crypto primitives for performing a remote attestation of the target Holder Wallet;
